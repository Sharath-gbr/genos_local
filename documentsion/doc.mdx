Replace the current simple Google OAuth (handled via NextAuth.js) with a robust email-based user registration process that integrates with Supabase as the backend.
   - The sign-up flow should include:
     - An email registration form with fields for email, password,first name, last name
     - Secure password handling (using libraries like bcrypt or Supabaseâ€™s built-in security features).
     - No Optional social login integration (e.g., Google) 
     - Proper error handling and form validation.
   - Develop the front-end component for the sign-up form.
   - Create backend API routes or use Supabase client libraries to handle user registration, store user data, and manage authentication.
   - Include detailed inline comments explaining how each part of the code works, and how security, performance, and maintainability best practices are followed.
