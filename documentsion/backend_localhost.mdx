Next.js API Routes Architecture
────────────────────────────
• Your backend is implemented using Next.js API routes (located in the app/api folder). This leverages Next.js’s native file-based routing to create endpoints. 
For example, the recipes endpoint in app/api/recipes/route.ts shows a clear pattern:
  – It declares an asynchronous GET handler that first checks for a valid user session via getServerSession from NextAuth.
  – After authentication, it queries Airtable, processes the results (including conditional handling for fields like images, phase, and protein meal type), 
and returns JSON data.
• Other API routes (in directories like plate-planner, blood-report, and medical-conditions) follow a similar pattern, ensuring that backend logic is 
encapsulated per feature, which helps maintain separation of concerns.

Authentication with NextAuth
────────────────────────────
• Your authentication endpoint is set up in app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts using NextAuth. The integration is straightforward:
  – GoogleProvider is configured using environment variables for clientId and clientSecret.
  – A custom pages object redirects sign-in attempts to '/login'.
  – Session and JWT callbacks are present, even though they’re straightforward (simply returning the session and token).
• The recipes endpoint demonstrates secure API access by calling getServerSession(authOptions) to ensure that only logged-in users access the data.
• Using JWT session strategy in NextAuth is a scalable choice for stateless authentication. However, you might consider expanding the callbacks with 
additional user metadata in the future if your application grows.

Airtable Integration
────────────────────────────
• The airtable integration is handled in lib/airtable.ts. Key points include:
  – Configuration is performed at startup by obtaining the API key and base ID from environment variables.
  – An Airtable base instance is created immediately via Airtable.configure, followed by exposing an instance (airtableBase) for direct operations.
  – Utility functions such as getPatientRecords, getAllRecords, and getRecordById wrap Airtable queries, making interactions consistent across endpoints.
• The recipes API and plate-planner API routes both rely on these Airtable functions/instances. This ensures that your code for connecting to a third-party 
service is centralized rather than duplicated across endpoints.
────────────────────────────
Error Handling and Logging
────────────────────────────
• Throughout the endpoints, you’re using try/catch blocks to catch errors and log detailed error information, including message and stack trace.
 This is particularly visible in the recipes API endpoint.
  – Logging raw data (e.g., in the recipes endpoint, logging fields before and after processing) helps with debugging, although you may consider removing 
or gating such detailed logs in production.
• The error responses are handled gracefully using NextResponse.json that returns generic error messages along with appropriate HTTP status 
codes (e.g., 401 for unauthorized access, 500 for server errors), which is good for preventing leakage of sensitive details to the client.
────────────────────────────
Overall Code Structure and Best Practices
────────────────────────────
• Code is organized in a modular fashion:
  – API routes are separated by functionality (recipes, auth, plate planner, etc.), which aids in maintainability and scalability.
  – Reusable usages like Airtable integration are in the lib folder.
  – Authentication logic sits in a dedicated auth directory within app/api.
• TypeScript is used (as seen in various file extensions and type annotations), which adds type safety especially around API contracts and external service calls.
• Use of environment variables in managing external configurations (e.g., Airtable API keys, NextAuth secrets) follows best practices 
for security and configuration.

Opportunities for Improvement
────────────────────────────
• Consolidate Logging:
  – Consider using a more structured and environment-aware logging system that toggles verbose logs only during development. 
This would add a layer of security and performance in production.
• Enhanced Validation:
  – Depending on the complexity of user input, consider implementing input validation (e.g., with Zod or Yup) especially in routes 
that might accept user-provided parameters.
• Error Reporting:
  – Integrating tools like Sentry could improve error monitoring and help with proactive error tracking beyond console logging.
• Configuration Files:
  – While NextAuth and Airtable integrations work as expected, always ensure the environment variables are well-documented in your .env.example 
file so that future developers have clear guidance.
• Expand JWT Callbacks:
  – If user roles or additional metadata become necessary, the basic JWT and session callbacks in NextAuth could be expanded to include and manage 
this extra information.
